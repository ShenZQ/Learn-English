A court in east China’s Zhejiang Province has upheld a decision to impose fines of 78 million yuan (US$12 million) on three Zhejiang companies that worked together to dispose of 26,000 tons of hazardous waste in rivers.

Hangzhou Intermediate Court said in a statement yesterday that it had upheld the ruling of a lower district court on the Second Chemical Plant of Jiande City, the Hong’an Cargo Company and the Rongsheng Chemical Company.

The Second Chemical Plant mainly produces glyphosate, a weed-killer.

In 2012 to 2013, it asked the other two companies to help dispose of waste into rivers in provincial capital Hangzhou and Quzhou, and in Jiangxi and Shandong provinces.

Neither of the companies was licensed to dispose of dangerous waste, the court said.

Zhejiang’s environmental protection research institute estimated that dealing with the pollution could cost as much as 80 million yuan.

Ten people, including the heads of the three companies, have been sentenced to jail terms ranging from one year and 10 months to nine years, and also fined a total of 8.5 million yuan.
