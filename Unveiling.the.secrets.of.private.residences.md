When Hangzhou’s West Lake was made a _**UNESCO**_ World _**Heritage**_ Site in 2011, it was described as reflecting “an _**idealized fusion**_ between humans and nature.”
>UNESCO--"United Nationas Educational,Scientific,and Cultural Organization"联合国教科文组织  
>heritage--"遗产"的意思  
>idealized--形容词，"理想化的"的意思  
>fusion--"融合、溶化、融合物"的意思，同义的还有"melt"、"merge"

The lake may be neither the largest nor the deepest, but what makes it unique is its _**exceptionally**_ pretty _**surroundings**_ — evergreen trees, flowers, rolling hills and mountains to form the _**backdrop**_, as well as traditional Chinese gardens and buildings.
>exceptionally--"异常地、特殊地、例外地"  
>surrounding--"环境，周围的事物"  
>backdrop--"背景、背景幕"  

The architecture around the lake has been among the most important sources of _**inspiration**_ for Chinese garden designers, and has _**influenced**_ garden design in the rest of China and East Asia.
>inspiration--[,ɪnspə'reʃən],"创意、灵感、启发"的意思  
>influence--"影响"的意思  

Today, Shanghai Daily will introduce you to two classical gardens in the city for your next visit this spring.
***
## Guo’s _**Villa**_
>villa--['vɪlə]，"别墅、郊区住宅"的意思  

While much of the West Lake’s architecture has influenced other parts of China and East Asia, Guo’s Villa is described as the most _**outstanding**_ and the most _**influential**_.
>outstanding--"杰出的、显著的"的意思   
>influential--"有影响的"意思  

The villa was built in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) by silk _**merchant**_ Song Duanfu. Later, Guo Shilin from Fenyang, Shanxi Province, bought the garden residence and gave it his family name, Guo.
>merchant--用名词时就是"商人、店主"的意思   

Unlike Western gardens that immediately expose a _**fascinating**_ colorful scenery, the beauty of Guo’s Villa takes a little effort to discover. Wandering through the _**intricate compound**_ way feels like opening a _**scroll painting**_ — bit by bit, you discover its charm.
>fascinating--['fæsɪneɪtɪŋ]，"迷人的、使人神魂颠倒的"的意思   
>intricate compound--intricate['ɪntrɪkət]"复杂的、错综的"意思，compound"复合的、混合的"意思   
>scroll painting--"画卷"的意思
   
Entering the villa, people come to a _**corridor**_ leading to the main hall, and then a _**pavilion**_ with plants and rocks. To the left, there is an open space with various trees and flowers and two small _**arch gates**_ that lead to a wide _**terrace**_ facing the West Lake.
>corridor--['kɔrɪdɔr],"走廊、过道、通道"的意思   
>pavilion--[pə'vɪljən],"亭子"的意思   
>arch gate--"拱形门"的意思   
>terrace--['terəs],"平台、阳台"的意思，还有"梯田"的意思   

At the another end there is a _**pond**_ in which the color of the sky and the water seem to merge.
>pond--"池塘"的意思   

Chinese traditional architecture _**aesthetics**_ are largely used.
>aesthetics--[ɛs'θɛtɪks],"美学"的意思   

Along the corridors, glassless windows are built on the height of your eye, making it possible to look at flowers outside as if they are framed photos on a wall.

The plants and decorations behind the walls are so _**delicately**_ arranged that they are always within your eyesight.
>delicately--"微妙地、精致地"意思

The wide terrace facing the _**tranquil**_ West Lake is designed to relax and enjoy the lake as well as the _**Su Causeway**_ and Leifeng _**Pagoda**_ in the distance, an example of Chinese architecture’s principal of “_**view borrowing**_” as the lake’s view is “borrowed” in the garden.
>tranquil--['træŋkwɪl],"安静的、平静的、宁静的"意思   
>Su Causeway--苏堤
>pagoda--[pə'gəʊdə]，"宝塔"的意思  
>view borrowing--"借景" 的意思 

At the terrace, one stone table is arranged at the north end so people can watch the pagoda in the south, while the other table is set up in south for people to look toward causeway in the north.

Indeed, “one step one view” is a _**vital**_ method of Chinese architecture. It means that scenery should change as the viewer changes his position. _**Given**_ that _**upper-class**_ women were not allowed to leave their homes in ancient times, they need to live in a place that brought the world to them.
>vital--"至关重要的、非常必要的"意思  
>given--在这里是介词，"考虑到"的意思  
>upper-class--"上流社会的"意思  

You could haste through the garden in less than 10 minutes, but to really see and understand its beauty, you should schedule in an hour or more.

>Address: 28 Yanggong Causeway   
>Admission: 10 yuan (US$1.53)

## _**Former Residence**_ of Hu Xueyan
>former residence--  

A late Qing Dynasty _**herb**_ merchant and one of the most famous merchants in modern China, Hu Xueyan, built one of the most _**luxurious**_ private homes in the country in 1827. It is now open to the public and receives thousands of visitors every day.

While a tour of Guo’s Villa helps people to understand how Chinese _**noblemen**_ used to organize their gardens, a tour to Hu Xueyan’s Former Residence tells you more about the life of a _**wealthy**_ Chinese at the time.

Hu, whose fortune amounted to about half of the country’s _**annual revenue**_, lived a _**relatively**_ _**humble**_ life — at least if you look at it from the outside. The gate of his house is so small it could easily be missed.

However, the _**interior**_ is _**marvellous**_.

The first room you enter already impresses with two Chinese sedans with intricate _**carvings**_ and decorations, and _**pillars**_ made of _**gingko**_, a very slow-growing, expensive wood.

As with Guo’s Villa, the house doesn’t reveal all its beauty at once. So we suggest you take your time to walk through the house, which was home to Hu’s wife and a total of 12 _**concubines**_.

The house features mosaic glass, Roman column-style barrels, and a garden specifically designed for sunbathing — a habit Hu learned from his Western business partners.

Much of the building is made from _**precious**_ _**rosewood**_. Hu’s favorite concubine was treated better than the rest, and received her own kitchen and dining hall.

Behind the main buildings were rooms for Hu’s 19 children, and behind that lies the mansion’s back garden, a typical Chinese style garden with a pond, _**artificial**_ rocks and a cave, as well as pavilions and small buildings.

The paths were designed as a _**maze**_.

Opposite to rock formations, the highest of the 13 buildings is the main _**mansion**_, which makes for an ideal photo backdrop.

The wood, stone and brick carvings were made by some of the best _**artisans**_ of the 19th century.

>Address: 18 Yuanbao St   
>Admission: 20 yuan (US$3.06)
