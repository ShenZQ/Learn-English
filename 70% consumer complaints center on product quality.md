Consumer complaints the Hangzhou _**market watchdog**_ received in 2015 are 70 percent about product quality and 30 percent about services.
>market watchdog--"市场监管机构"的意思   

Clothes and shoes, food, household products, electronic products, and home appliances topped the quality complaints. Retail service, catering and hotel service, property management, product repair service and telecom service topped the service complaints.

Complaints from online shoppers increased sharply last year _**in tandem with**_ a fast-growing e-commerce.
>in tandem with--"同...合作；串联"的意思，在这里可以意译为"与电子商务的快速增长相关"。  

Also yesterday, the Hangzhou Price Bureau reminded drivers to avoid paying high parking fees in the West Lake Scenic Area. Parking is free for the first 15 minutes, but is charged 10 yuan (US$1.54) for the first hour and 5 yuan for every half hour afterwards.

A parking fee notice sign can be seen in every parking lot around the West Lake. People can call 12358 for _**inquiry**_ or complaint.
>inquiry--"质询"的意思
