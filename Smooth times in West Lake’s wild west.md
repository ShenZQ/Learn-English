>smooth time--"平滑的时间"，可以理解为"安逸的时光"  

When _**magnificent**_ _**waterfront**_ and the surrounding areas are packed with tourists, the west side of the West Lake remains a _**quaint**_ paradise of farmers who live a relaxed life among temples and a naturally _**tranquil**_ environment.

>quaint--[kweɪnt]，"古雅的"意思   
>tranquil--['træŋkwɪl]，"安静的、平静的"意思  

Here, the air smells clean and fresh, making it a true joy to take a deep breath while listening to tweeting birds. Relax in a garden, enjoy freshly prepared tea and burn some _**incense**_ in centuries-old temple — Shanghai Daily has taken a day trip to the West Lake’s _**picturesque**_ west and shows you the best spots to _**delve**_ into its wild side.
>incense--作名词时为"香"的意思，作动词时为"焚香"的意思  
>picturesque--[,pɪktʃə'resk]，"图画般的"意思  
>delve--"探究"的意思  

The morning is reserved for some _**spirituality**_ at Lingyin Temple, where you can _**meditate**_ and find you inner peace, or, if you have trouble finding your _**zen**_, you can go simply to see the splendid _**Buddhist**_ architecture. Hangzhou is often described as “Southeast Buddhist Country” because its temples have particularly _**devout**_ followers, and Lingyin is one of its ultimate gems.
>spirituality--[,spɪrɪtjʊ'ælətɪ]，"灵性"的意思  
>meditate--['medɪteɪt],"冥想、沉思"的意思  
>zen--"禅"的意思  
>buddhist--作名词时为"佛教徒"的意思，作形容词时为"佛教的"意思  
>devout--"虔诚的、忠心的"意思  

The temple’s name literally means “temple of the soul’s retreat” in Chinese. Being one of the largest Buddhist temples in China, it contains _**numerous**_ pagodas and Buddhist _**grottoes**_. The most famous is Feilai Peak (the peak that flew hither) located in front of the main temple.
>numerous--"许多的、很多的"意思  
>grotto--"洞穴、人工石室"的意思，可译为"石窟"   

The peak is made of _**craggy**_ _**limestone**_ that, according to legend, stems from India and was flown to Hangzhou _**overnight**_ to demonstrate the power of Buddhism.
>craggy--['kræɡi]，"崎岖的、多峭壁的"意思   
>limestone--"石灰岩"的意思   
>overnight--既有"通宵"的意思，也有"突然"的意思  

Lingyin provides _**worshippers**_ with simple, mild _**vegetarian**_ food made of local vegetables and noodles.
>worshipper--"崇拜者、礼拜者"的意思，这里可译成"香客、朝拜者"   
>vegetarian--"素食的"意思  

After filling your mind with _**serenity**_ and your _**belly**_ with noodles, get ready for the afternoon trip to Manjuelong Village, known among locals as “home to loads of tea.” Vast tea bush plantations roll over _**gentle slopes**_, _**seemingly**_ _**engulfing**_ visitors who walk through them.
>serenity--[sɪ'renɪtɪ],"平静、宁静"的意思   
>belly--"肚子、胃"的意思   
>gentle slope--"平缓的斜坡"的意思   
>seemingly--"看来似乎、表面上看"的意思   
>engulfing--"engulf"的现在分词,"吞没"的意思   

A bird’s eye view from a nearby mountaintop is the best way to take in and _**appreciate**_ the tea plantations. The hill rises gently and wide stone steps are well laid out so the climb is not difficult.
>appreciate--"欣赏、领会"的意思   

Hangzhou is the home of Longjing tea, known around the country for its high quality and great taste. Longjing Village is famous for its tea, but if you want to escape the crowds, few _**out-of-town**_ visitors know that Manjuelong Village is equally beautiful and also produces the high-end tea.
>out-of-town--"外地的"意思   

Most villagers _**earn a living**_ from growing Longjing tea. As the temperature rises, the harvest time for spring tea has just started, and you can watch as locals picked the tea leaves before the Qingming Festival, which falls on April 4 this year. These leaves are considered the most _**precious**_ and said to be of the very highest quality. Traditionally, people named them Mingqian Longjing.
>earn a living--"谋生"的意思   
>precious--['prɛʃəs]，"宝贵的、珍贵的"意思  

Because the leaves grow slower in the cooler weather, they are said to be softer and _**mellower**_ in taste, making them more expensive than tea harvested later in the season. Prices can range from 1,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan per kilogram. This winter, many tea trees _**suffered**_ from _**frostbite**_, which drives up prices.
>mellow--"芳醇的"意思   
>suffer--"遭受、经历、受伤害"的意思   
>frostbite--"冻伤、霜寒"的意思   

A few years ago, some locals turned their homes into _**family-run**_ _**guesthouses**_ and teahouses featuring white wall and black-tiled roofs. Now, they provide guests with _**homey**_ accommodation, fresh tea and traditional Hangzhou food.
>family-run--"家庭运营"的意思   
>guesthouse--"宾馆、小型家庭旅馆"的意思   
>homey--"舒适的、家庭似的"意思   

It’s the perfect location to slow down and enjoy a more _**conscious**_ life — wander on green slopes, take photos in the garden, or just sit somewhere with a cup of tea and relax. If you’re interested in culture and traditions, tea _**ceremonies**_ are performed in some teahouses.
>conscious--['kɑnʃəs]，"神志清醒的"意思   
>ceremonies--['sɛrə'monɪz]，"仪式、典礼、礼节"的意思，"tea ceremonies"可译为"茶艺"的意思     

From late March to May, Hangzhou will host the Tea Culture Expo, with many activities focusing on tea scheduled in the Longjing growing villages.

The newly opened Hangzhou Midtown _**Shangri-La**_ Hotel is at the _**intersection**_ of Wulin and Qingchun roads, a great location in the West Lake Scenic Area. In addition, the connected Kerry Center — a modern complex with an office building, apartments and a high-end shopping mall — is also expected to open in September. The hotel offers _**discounted**_ rooms with breakfast _**buffet**_ and _**laundry**_ service at 1,100 yuan (US$169, _**exclusive of**_ a 15 percent _**service charge**_) from now until May 31.
