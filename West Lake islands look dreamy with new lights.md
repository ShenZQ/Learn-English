>dreamy--"梦幻般的、如梦似幻"的意思   

The three islands in the West Lake take on a _**splendid**_ view after dark thanks to an upgrade of landscape lighting, which transforms Xiao Ying Zhou, Hu Xin Ting, and Ruan Gong Dun into glowing sights with reflections on _**rippling**_ water around them.
>splendid--"灿烂的、辉煌的"意思   
>rippling--"起涟漪的"意思   

The West Lake management _**authority**_ began a project last August to upgrade the _**scenic**_ lighting system on the three islands. The work finished recently.
>authority--"权力、权威、当局"的意思  
>scenic--[ˈsinɪk]，"风景优美的"意思  

The new lighting system is more colorful and dynamic with computer control to change visual effects according to different seasons.  It is the first intelligent lighting system in China.

The three islands now look more beautiful and poetic at night with new lights that change effects at _**synchronized pace**_.
>synchronized pace--['sɪŋkrənaɪzd]，"同步的速度"的意思
